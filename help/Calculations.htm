<P><STRONG>Calculations<BR></STRONG>The debugger allows 
usage of basic math operations, just type an expression in the command window 
and the result will be displayed in the console.</P>
<P><STRONG>Operators</STRONG><BR>You can use the following operators 
in your expression. They are resolved in the order of the list.</P>
<P><U>1:</U><U>brackets</U>: '(' and ')' Brackets are 
resolved first, there is no need for a terminating bracket, unless you want to 
use one.</P>
<P><U>2:not</U>: '~' The not operator can be used before a 
number of a variable, like in C.</P>
<P><U>3:addition/substraction</U>: '+' and '-'</P>
<P><U>4:muliplication/devision</U>: '*' = regular 
multiplication (signed/unsigned), '#' = get the higher part of the 
multiplication, '/' = regular devision (signed/unsigned, devide by zero=error) 
and '%' = get the modulo (remainder) of the devision.</P>
<P><U>5:shift</U>: '&lt;' = shift left (shl for unsigned, 
sal for signed), '&gt;' = shift right (shr for unsigned, sar for signed).</P>
<P><U>6:and</U>: '&amp;' Just the regular AND operation like 
in C.</P>
<P><U>7:xor</U>: '^' Just the regular XOR operation like in 
C.</P>
<P><U>8:or</U>: '|' Just the regular OR operation like in 
C.</P></body>
